# Syllabus - Introduction to Python for Finance

In this course, we will introduce basic python concepts and explore their use in financial context. This course is aimed for students who want
to learn python from scratch.

- usage of Git and Github
- setup of Python development with virtual environment
- lecture notes will be done with jupyter/colab notebook

## Chapter 1: Basics in data analysis with Python
- introduction to typical software packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy
- introduction to datatypes, like dataframes and dictionaries
- visualization techniques using matplotlib/seaborn
- basic python knowledge (how to structure code)

## Chapter 2: Financial Time Series Analysis with Python
- AR, MA, ARMA modelling
- stylized facts on financial time series and their implications
- volatility models: ARCH & GARCH
- combination of both: ARMA-GARCH Extensions
