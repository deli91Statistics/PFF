# Syllabus - Introduction to Python for Finance

In this course, we will introduce basic python concepts and explore their use in financial econometrics.

First, we demonstrate how to use python to manipulate data. Given any project, "data crunching" usually consumes most of the time hence it is essential to have a good command of the vast amount of tools python offers. In particular, we will investigate packages such as pandas and numpy.

The second part of the course introduces financial time series. Here, we will discuss their unique characteristics also known as "stylized facts" and different approaches on how to model them.

<br/>

Prerequisites on programming languages:<br/>
No python knowledge is required although a basic understanding of coding principles is helpful. We will not discuss the theory of the language itself but focus
on its application.

Prerequisites on theory:<br/>
A basic understanding of univeriate time series is helpful but not required. Basic statistical concepts and some linear algebra.
